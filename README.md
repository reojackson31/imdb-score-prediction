# IMDb Score Prediction using Regression models in R
##### *- Project for MMA MGSC661 - Multivariate Statistical Analysis, McGill University*

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to predict IMDb ratings for upcoming movies using various regression models in R. The project explores the predictions given by different models and compares them based on their accuracy, predictive power, and interpretability. 

## Models Tested
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Spline Regression
- Local Regression
